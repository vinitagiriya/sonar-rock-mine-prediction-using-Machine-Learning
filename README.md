# sonar-rock-mine-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A simple machine learning project using Logistic Regression to predict whether a sonar signal is bouncing off a rock (R) or a mine (M). Built in Google Colab with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on real sonar data. Dataset used: [UCI Sonar Dataset].
